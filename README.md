# java-login-page
I built a Login Page and a Welcome Page to a fictional bookstore using JAVA.
There is an updated version of this code on my account with accounts for the shortcomings of this code. It us titled "JavaLoginPage2.0"
However, I will leave the code here as a showcase of my growth in coding.
